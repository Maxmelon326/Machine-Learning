    "The accuracy score reported is 0.9826, which means that the model correctly classified 98.26% of the test instances.\n",
    "However, the classification report provides more insights into the model's performance. It shows that the model has a high precision of 0.98 for the positive class (malware = 1), which means that when the model predicts an instance as malware, it is correct 98% of the time. However, the recall for the negative class (malware = 0) is very low at 0.33, which means that the model misses many instances of non-malware and incorrectly classifies them as malware.\n",
    "The F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is low for the negative class (0.50) and high for the positive class (0.99). This imbalance is likely due to the class imbalance in the dataset, where there are significantly more instances of malware (8550) compared to non-malware (226).\n",
    "Overall, while the model has a high accuracy, it performs poorly in correctly identifying non-malware instances. This issue could potentially be addressed by using techniques such as oversampling the minority class or adjusting the classification threshold."

    "Q3: Explain your findings and report the best performance.\n",
    "Based on the results from the two Questions provided, we can make the following observations and report the best performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Characteristics**:\n",
    "   - The dataset appears to be imbalanced, with a significantly higher number of instances belonging to the positive class (malware = 1) compared to the negative class (malware = 0). Specifically, there are 8550 instances of malware and only 226 instances of non-malware.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Performance on the Original Setup**:\n",
    "   - The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier with 10 hidden layers and the default settings achieved an overall accuracy of 0.9826 (98.26%) on the test set.\n",
    "   - However, the classification report revealed that the model performed poorly in correctly identifying non-malware instances, with a recall of only 0.33 for the negative class.\n",
    "   - This issue is likely due to the class imbalance in the dataset, where the model is biased towards the majority class (malware).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Impact of Activation Functions**:\n",
    "   - The second question evaluated the impact of different activation functions (identity, logistic, tanh, and relu) on the model's performance.\n",
    "   - The 'relu' (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9827 (98.27%) on the test set.\n",
    "   - The 'identity' activation function also performed well, with an accuracy of 0.9814 (98.14%).\n",
    "   - The 'logistic' and 'tanh' activation functions had slightly lower accuracies of 0.9742 (97.42%).  \n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Best Performance**:\n",
    "   - Based on the results, the best performance was achieved by the MLP classifier with 10 hidden layers, using the 'relu' activation function and the Adam solver.\n",
    "   - This configuration yielded an overall accuracy of 0.9827 (98.27%) on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that while the model achieved high overall accuracy, its performance in correctly identifying non-malware instances was poor due to the class imbalance. To improve the model's performance on the minority class, additional techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or adjusting the classification threshold may be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it's recommended to evaluate the model's performance using metrics that are more suitable for imbalanced datasets, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), rather than relying solely on accuracy."
